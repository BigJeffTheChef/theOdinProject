# Notes

## File structure

- use all lowercase when creating files and folders for the website to standardise and keep simple
- use /css/ /img/ etc not /cascadingstylesheets/ /images/ etc to keep writting links quick and easy
- avoid numbers, spaces, symbols etc
- keep them descriptive

## images - what to use and when

- `.jpg` good for photos, decent compression, no transparency
- `.gif` limited color palette, can handle animation, can have transparent pixel as a binary choice
- `.png` anything that's not a photo or animated (icons, diagrams, logos etc) - can handle opacity fine
- `.svg` vector images - scalable. text can balloon file sizes rather drastically

don't forget your `alt` attribute!
